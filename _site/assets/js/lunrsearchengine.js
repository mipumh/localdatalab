As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using.   Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: 123. my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}HTML12345&lt;li class= ml-1 mr-1 &gt;  &lt;a target= _blank  href= # &gt;  &lt;i class= fab fa-twitter &gt;&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;CSS12345678. highlight . c {  color: #999988;  font-style: italic; }. highlight . err {  color: #a61717;  background-color: #e3d2d2; }JS: 123456789// alertbar later$(document). scroll(function () {  var y = $(this). scrollTop();  if (y &gt; 280) {    $('. alertbar'). fadeIn();  } else {    $('. alertbar'). fadeOut();  }});Python: 1print( Hello World )Ruby: 123require 'redcarpet'markdown = Redcarpet. new( Hello World! )puts markdown. to_htmlC: 1printf( Hello World ); Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy.

Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.

Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story. The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes. As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.

Here are some additional details: bundler is a gem that manages other Ruby gems. It makes sure your gems and gem versions are compatible, and that you have all necessary dependencies each gem requires. The Gemfile and Gemfile. lock files inform Bundler about the gem requirements in your site. If your site doesn’t have these Gemfiles, you can omit bundle exec and just run jekyll serve. When you run bundle exec jekyll serve, Bundler uses the gems and versions as specified in Gemfile. lock to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts. For more information about how to use Bundler in your Jekyll project, this tutorial should provide answers to the most common questions and explain how to get up and running quickly. "

Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end. It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life. "
